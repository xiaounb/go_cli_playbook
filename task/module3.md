## Purpose of this module
This module will teach you how to use `go get` to download and install packages.
We will learn the `go get` command and what needs to be provided to it.


## Verify locally
To test this module locally:
* Open up a terminal at the project root
* Run command `cd test` to change to the `test` directory
* Run command `go test -run Module3` to run all tests for module 3, or
* Run command `go test -v -run Module3` to run all tests for module 3 with verbose information

## Task 1
To add dependencies to current module and install the packages, we use the [`go get` command](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Add_dependencies_to_current_module_and_install_them).
The syntax can be as simple as this:
```
go get <package>
```

The above `package` can be the git repo of the package if hosted on github (that is, without the `https://` prefix).

Your task is to write a command to import the following package which can be used to retrieve the sunrise and sunset time given a location and a date. Here is the github repo:
